## CMake Templates ##

These are some CMake templates I made not just for myself but to help others get
started with using CMake since it seems that good CMake tutorials simply don't
exist on the internet, leaving new would-be CMake users confused and in the dark
as I once was.

The c_cpp_proj folder is meant to represent a typical C/C++ project structure
and the boost.python_proj folder is there to represent a Boost.Python project
structure, the latter of which is based on my experiences with reviving the
PyJuggler project.

Feel free to do what you may with these, and I'd be happy to accept any pull
requests that provide any new project types or any other general improvements.
