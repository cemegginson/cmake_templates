## CMake Templates ##

These are some CMake templates I made not just for myself but to help others get
started with using CMake since it seems that good CMake tutorials simply don't
exist on the internet, leaving new would-be CMake users confused and in the dark
as I once was.

Each CMakeLists.txt file in every template directory is heavily commented to
explain how they work and how to use them, and I've covered all of the issues
that led to me  spending way too much time banging my head against my desk.

Feel free to do what you may with these, and I'd be happy to accept any pull
requests that provide any new project types or any other general improvements.
